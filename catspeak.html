      <h2 class="textcenter">Vocalizing: Your cat has something to talk about</h2>
      <p>You'll learn a lot when you can interpret your cat's wide vocabulary of chirps and meows. They'll tell you when it's time to get up (at least in your cat's opinion), when they're feeling affectionate and if they're feeling threatened or are in pain.</p>
	  <p><strong>"Meow"</strong> is an all-purpose word. Your cat may be saying "meow" as a greeting ("Hey, how ya doin'?"), a command ("I want up, I want down, More food now"), an objection ("Touch me at your own risk") or an announcement ("Here's your mouse"). Some people have watched their cats walking around the house meowing to themselves.</p>
	  <p><strong>Chirps and trills</strong> are how a mother cat tells their kittens to follow them. Aimed at you, it probably means your cat wants you to follow them, usually to their food bowl. If you have more than one cat, you'll often hear them converse with each other this way.</p>
	  <p><strong>Purring</strong> is a sign of contentment (usually). Cats purr whenever they're happy, even while theyâ€™re eating. Sometimes, however, a cat may purr when they're anxious or sick, using their purr to comfort themself, like a child sucking their thumb.</p>
